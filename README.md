## My process

- Chose to use quite a git of CSS Grid for this challenge. I need the practice with Grid and the design is 2D with defined columns and rows.
- Since this is only my second time building a modal nav option I decided to get thru it and then go back and refactor the solution. My goal was to learn how to make the modal navigation more accessible and more efficiently coded.
- The modal has a hamburger icon button to open and an X icon button to close. My first pass thru the challenge I put the X close button inside the modal div. This format require a lot of grid styling that was awkward. I wanted to just be able to swap out the icon files for the open hamburger and the close X inside of the same button div.
